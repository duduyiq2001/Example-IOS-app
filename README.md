The app I want to build is an AR and AI based shopping companion called FITTLY that harnesses Core ML, Apple Neural Engine( for offline), and AR toolkit  FITTLY scans your exact body dimensions in real time using ARKit with LiDAR. It then generates a lifelike 3D avatar of you to virtually try on clothes, shoes, different hair styles and accessories from top brands in an immersive AR environment. This would allow you to see accurate fit, texture, and draping in real time—no guesswork and no need to go in-person shopping no more. The app’s AI would also utilize multi-model LLMs to  provide personalized style recommendations and suggest size adjustments based on your unique body data and style preference description. Additional features could include social sharing (“Snap & Share” your AR outfits), integration with retail partner catalogs for direct purchase, and a style history tracker, so you can revisit your favorite virtual outfits anytime. By merging advanced computer vision with AR and AI-driven personalization, FITTLY aims to revolutionize online fashion shopping—bringing confident, in-store experiences straight to your living room.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. It's a little tricky for me to navigate around the UI of Xcode, but I think I will get the hang of it soon.
2. There's no built in terminal in Xcode like in Vscode
3. Thinkering around the storyboard can lead to unexplicable errors sometimes, and they can be hard to debug.
